# PS4 Cheat Notes

Not the best notes in the world but if it can help someone learn from it in some way, why not.



## Programs

* [PlayStation 4 Tool Box](https://www.psxhax.com/threads/playstation-4-tool-box-2-2-1-140-bo3-1-33-lua-decompiled-dump-by-deathrgh.13308/) by DeathRGH ([support](https://ko-fi.com/deathrgh))
* [PS4 Cheater](https://github.com/ctn123/PS4_Cheater/releases) by Ctn ([support](https://ko-fi.com/Ctn123))

These 2 are the only ones I use, but there are others out there.

### Alternatives
* [Reaper Studio](https://ko-fi.com/s/579e6a2c93) by ShininGami ([support](https://ko-fi.com/shiningami/)) and Ctn
* [DX/Watch](https://ko-fi.com/s/9960cc66fd) by Zenithy ([support](https://ko-fi.com/zenithy/))
* [PS4CheaterNeo](https://github.com/avan06/PS4CheaterNeo/releases) by Avan06



## General Flow

1. Find dynamic address with PS4 Cheater
    * Dynamic address is an address that changes on restart/reboot/etc.
2. Find what writes to that address using the Debugger in PS4 Tool Box
    * Write down that address so we can use it to get the dynamic addresses without searching for it
3. Modify that address in step 2 to your liking

Note: This is a **very** general way of making a cheat, but it can, most of the time, go deeper than that.

If you're completely lost don't worry, check out [Helpful](#helpful) below for some ways to get a better grasp on it.

### YouTube

* [Game Hacking Shenanigans - Game Hacking Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt9cUwGw6CYFSoQHsf9b12kHWLdgYRhmQ) by Guided Hacking
    * This playlist is by far, in my opinion, the best when first learning the fundamentals of RE games. Even though they use it to make cheats for PC, the fundamentals of it are the same throughout.
* [Cheat The Game](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisFayte/) channel by Chris Fayte
    * When learning techniques on finding a certain cheat, Cheat The Game is my go to. Tons of useful videos.
* [StephenChapman](https://www.youtube.com/@StephenChapman/) channel by Stephen Chapman
    * Another useful channel that has tons of useful material like Cheat The Game.

### Books

* Beginning x64 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional by Jo Van Hoey
* Beginning C++17: From Novice to Professional by Ivor Horton and Peter Van Weert
    * Newer version is Beginning C++20: From Novice to Professional
* Reverse Engineering for Beginners (Understanding Assembly Language) by Dennis Yurichev

The books are recommended by Pharaoh2k, who is one, of many, top developers in the PS4 jailbreak scene. Pharaoh2k has made plenty of cheats, which I have no idea how he is able to come up with some cheats as they are really advanced. Pharaoh2k (like the devs mentioned in [Programs](#programs)), are amazing developers all around not just in making cheats. If a top dev recommends something, might be for a good reason. I'm halfway through the first book and can say it has helped me understand assembly and making cheats better.
